<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project
Alien Invaders is a game inspired by the original game Space Invaders
by Taito Corporation. Space Invaders was developed by Tomohiro Nishikado
and launched in 1978. The game was a tremendous success with grossed
$3.8 billion. I think we all know how fun this game is. For more information
about the original game [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders).

I have spent so many great hours in my childhood playing this game. On one weekend, 
I decided to make a quick clone with python. The game still lacks a couple of
functions, but it was close to what I have expected.

An executable file for macOS can be found in the `application_mac`
folder. Please feel free to check it out.

<!-- FEATURES -->
## Features
___
The game hasn't as many features or levels as the original game. Considered
that this project was done over a few hours on weekend. However, so far it has;
* Single level gameplay
* Main menu scene, game scene, and a credit scene
* Background sound and sound effects

Based on the amount of fun I had created this project, I might come back later to add
more levels to the game at a later time.
